Coconut ladoos are a rich, sweet dessert-snack. This is made for many festive occasions. Coconut laddoo is a very simple and easy recipe to make. These are made with few ingredients. Traditionally in Indian households ladoos are served as fudge candies.

Makes 14 ladoo

Preparation time 5 minutes
Cooking time 40 minutes

Ingredients:
1-1/4 cup coconut freshly grated or frozen, available in Indian grocery stores
3 cups milk
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
Â 
Method

Boil the milk and coconut in heavy bottom pan over medium high heat (I am using heavy non stick pan), do stir occasionally.
After milk comes to boil reduce the heat to medium and cook for 25-30 minutes, until all the moisture is absorbed and coconut is thick and creamy consistency.
Add sugar and cardamom to the coconut and cook for 7-8 minutes stir continuously, until all the moisture is absorbed. Coconut mix will be thick and crumbly in consistency. Turn off the heat.
Spread the coconut mix on the plate and let it cool of to the room temperature.
To make the ladoos, take about 2 tablespoons of coconut mixture into your palm. Gently press to form a smooth, round ball. Adjust the size of ladoo as you prefer.
Ladoos are ready to be served; you can refrigerate them for about two weeks.

Enjoy!
